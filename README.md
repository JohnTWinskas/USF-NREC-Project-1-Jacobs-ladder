###### [Metrology Engineer Jay Bieber](http://www.nrec.usf.edu/Staff.html) at the [University of South Florida-NREC (Nanotechnology Research &amp; Education Center)](http://www.nrec.usf.edu/Staff.html) assigned project #1 Jacobs ladder
### Prototype 1-
 - 2 pieces of  10'"  (1/2 a cm) copper wire, oil igniter (6Kv; 100 mA power supply), a power cord, and a switch. 
 - Used pliers to turn copper wire around positive and negative terminal of the oil igniter cut tip of power cord and peeled back rubber protective coating,
 - used wire stripper to strip positive & negative wires spliced power cord wires to positive and negative wires of oil igniter plugged in device to power strip.
 - listened for buzzing noise. unplugged from the power strip. adjusted copper wires 1 centimeter at base to 2 centimeters at top of ladder.
   
 - added a switch;
 - unspliced power cord wires from positive and negative wires of power supply;
 - Splice positive and negative wires to positive & negative wires of switch;
 - spliced positive and negative wires at other side of switch to positive and negative wires of terminal;
 - plugged power cord into power strip hopefully with the switch in the closed position.
 - Flipped switch to open position, observed space between copper wires for ionized air/plasma between copper wires.
 - Observed density differential caused by the heat of the plasma;
 - creating an upward movement of the plasma between the copper wires until reaching the apex or top of the ladder.
 - Then the dissolution of the plasma at the top of the device and the formation of a new plasma at the bottom of the copper wires where the copper wires are closest. 
  
### Prototype 2 Copper Wire Protection.  
Used brackets to fasten 2 plywood boards together at a 90-degree angle to protect individuals from the ionized air/plasma between the copper wires and fastened power supply to the bottom board.

### Prototype 3 Created Jacobs ladder 
For NREC demonstrations from an oil igniter, powercord, Cell phone stand and plexi-glass, worked with machine shop to cut spacings for cell phone holder allowing plexiglass to fit into cell phone stand to protect users from ionized air/plasma generated from the 6000v 100mA power supply.
